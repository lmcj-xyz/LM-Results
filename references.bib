	abstract = {A new concept of a galloping-random wind energy harvester, which is a galloping-based piezoelectric harvester mounted on a buoy platform is proposed. The galloping-random wind energy harvester can concurrently harvest galloping energy due to the aero-instability and stochastic vibration energy due to the ocean wave. The harvester performance is comprehensively investigated through wind tunnel experiments and theoretical investigation. The mathematical model of the system is formulated, and its aerodynamic galloping is then validated with wind tunnel experimental measurements. Based on the verified mathematical model of the galloping-random wind energy harvester, the stochastic average method is applied to analytically obtain the probability density func­ tions of the system’s stochastic responses and the average harvested power. The fidelity of the analytical solution is also verified by the numerical integration using the Euler-Maruyama algorithm. The results show that a unique crater phenomenon is discovered in the joint {PDF} of the responses, owing to the concurrent galloping and sto­ chastic vibrations. In this case, the energy harvester exhibits a periodic galloping response with a fluctuating amplitude. The annulus range is wider when the galloping response is dominant and becomes stronger. In addition, this study investigates the average power output in terms of the stochastic excitation intensity, structural natural frequency, aerodynamic mass ratio, and normalized electrical term, to provide the useful design guidelines. The results show that the strong stochastic excitation intensity is beneficial to broadband energy harvesting and especially provides a high advantage for the low wind speed. The low structural natural frequency and large aerodynamic mass ratio can improve the performance. The parametric study also uncovers the optimal electrical term that can significantly improve the broadband average power output.},

First we revisit well-posedness of the the corresponding martingale problem and the continuity of the solution with respect to the drift b. Second we show that the solutions are weak Dirichlet processes for which we evaluate the quadratic variation of the martingale component. Third we introduce a ”proper” notion of solution to the {SDE} and under suitable assumption we show equivalence with martingale problem.},

	abstract = {The book contains a unitary and systematic presentation of both classical and very recent parts of a fundamental branch of functional analysis: linear semigroup theory with main emphasis on examples and applications. There are several specialized, but quite interesting, topics which didn't find their place into a monograph till now, mainly because they are very new. So, the book, although containing the main parts of the classical theory of C{\textless}{INF}{\textgreater}o{\textless}/{INF}{\textgreater}-semigroups, as the Hille-Yosida theory, includes also several very new results, as for instance those referring to various classes of semigroups such as equicontinuous, compact, differentiable, or analytic, as well as to some nonstandard types of partial differential equations, i.e. elliptic and parabolic systems with dynamic boundary conditions, and linear or semilinear differential equations with distributed (time, spatial) measures. Moreover, some finite-dimensional-like methods for certain semilinear pseudo-parabolic, or hyperbolic equations are also disscussed. Among the most interesting applications covered are not only the standard ones concerning the Laplace equation subject to either Dirichlet, or Neumann boundary conditions, or the Wave, or Klein-Gordon equations, but also those referring to the Maxwell equations, the equations of Linear Thermoelasticity, the equations of Linear Viscoelasticity, to list only a few. Moreover, each chapter contains a set of various problems, all of them completely solved and explained in a special section at the end of the book. The book is primarily addressed to graduate students and researchers in the field, but it would be of interest for both physicists and engineers. It should be emphasised that it is almost self-contained, requiring only a basic course in Functional Analysis and Partial Differential Equations.},

            A simple rigorous approach is given to generalized functions, suitable for applications. Here, a generalized function is defined as a genuine function on a superset of the real line, so that multiplication is unrestricted and associative, and various manipulations retain their classical meanings. The superset is simply constructed, and does not require Robinson's nonstandard real line. The generalized functions go beyond the Schwartz distributions, enabling products and square roots of delta functions to be discussed.},

	abstract = {These notes are based on a series of lectures given first at the University of Warwick in spring 2008 and then at the Courant Institute in spring 2009. It is an attempt to give a reasonably self-contained presentation of the basic theory of stochastic partial differential equations, taking for granted basic measure theory, functional analysis and probability theory, but nothing else. The approach taken in these notes is to focus on semilinear parabolic problems driven by additive noise. These can be treated as stochastic evolution equations in some infinite-dimensional Banach or Hilbert space that usually have nice regularising properties and they already form a very rich class of problems with many interesting properties. Furthermore, this class of problems has the advantage of allowing to completely pass under silence many subtle problems arising from stochastic integration in infinite-dimensional spaces.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider an energy storage optimization problem in finite time in a model with partial information that allows for a changing economic environment. The state process consists of the storage level controlled by the storage manager and the energy price process, which is a diffusion process the drift of which is assumed to be unobservable. We apply filtering theory to find an alternative state process which is adapted to our observation filtration. For this alternative state process, we derive the associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation and solve the optimization problem numerically. This results in a candidate for the optimal policy for which it is a priori not clear whether the controlled state process exists. Hence, we prove an existence and uniqueness result for a class of time-inhomogeneous stochastic differential equations with discontinuous drift and singular diffusion coefficient. Finally, we apply our result to prove admissibility of the candidate optimal control.},

	shorttitle = {Numerical Methods for Backward Stochastic Differential Equations},
	abstract = {Backwards Stochastic Differential Equations ({BSDEs}) have been widely employed in various areas of applied and financial mathematics. In particular, {BSDEs} appear extensively in the pricing and hedging of financial derivatives, stochastic optimal control problems and optimal stopping problems. Most {BSDEs} cannot be solved analytically and thus numerical methods must be applied in order to approximate their solutions. There have been many numerical methods proposed over the past few decades, for the most part, in a complex and scattered manner, with each requiring a variety of different and similar assumptions and conditions. The aim of the present paper is thus to systematically survey various numerical methods for {BSDEs}, and in particular, compare and categorise them. To this end, we focus on the core features of each method: the main assumptions, the numerical algorithm itself, key convergence properties and advantages and disadvantages, in order to provide an exhaustive up-to-date coverage of numerical methods for {BSDEs}, with insightful summaries of each and useful comparison and categorization.},
